# Processing code for "Constraining black carbon aging in global models to reflect timescales for internal mixing"
Description: This repository contains the processing script used in the analysis presented in Fierce et al. (2024). Constraining black carbon aging in global models to reflect timescales for internal mixing. JAMES (under review).

The CAM aging data used in the analysis is provided at: https://portal.nersc.gov/project/m1657/BC-aging-CAM-data/. The particle-resolved simulations were performed with PartMC version 2.1.5 (https://github.com/compdyn/partmc), and the version of mosaic was mosaic-2012-0125 (available from Rahul Zaveri). Scenarios are described in: Fierce, L., Riemer, N., & Bond, T. C. (2017). Toward reduced representation of mixing state for simulating aerosol effects on climate. Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society, 98(5), 971-980.
